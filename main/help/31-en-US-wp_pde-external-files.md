For adding an external file to the plugin, open the `External Files` box from the
`Screen Options`. Enter a folder name (relative to the plugin directory) in the
`Folder` text field. Use the `Browse` button to select a file from the local system.
Click on `Add to Plugin`. PDE adds the file to the plugin.

Please note that PDE makes a copy of the file and saves it in the wordpress database.
The changes made to the file using PDE's editor, do not reflect in the original file.

If you want to replace an external file in the plugin, delete the file from the PDE
project and add it again using the above instructions.

You can also add new empty files to your plugin. Use the `Folder` and `File Name` text
fields below in the same meta box.

WpPDE also provides a multi file uploader using the same `plupload` plugin used by 
WordPress.

#### Including the files

When you upload either a javascript, php or a css file - you can let PDE include them
when the plugin is loaded. The `External Files` box, displays all the uploaded files
and provides options to `require` (for PHP files) and `enqueue` them for the javascript
and css files.
