PDE includes `About this Plugin` box that allows you to easily create a `readme.txt`
in WordPress plugin repository format or `readme.md` for those us who use github.

For creating a `readme.txt` or `readme.md` file enter the information in the
`About this Plugin` box and save the information. Next time, when the plugin files
are generated using `Save Plugin` option - the readme files are created.

Note that some of this information is used to generate the main plugin file header.
So even if you do not want to create readme files, it is useful to provide the
information and save it.
