Using PDE you can create plugin elements that contain forms like widgets, meta boxes etc.

Each of the plugin elements that support forms allows you to add form fields like text boxes,
dropdown lists etc. from the `Form Elements` box.

PDE's form editor supports structured forms. By indenting a set of form elements below another
element, the indented form elements are grouped together using a div.

The `Checkbox`, `Radio Button` and `Dropdown Item` elements of the form elements provide special
functionality by which the child elements can be shown/hidden when these elements are selected.

The `Text Field`, `Text Area` and `Password` fields provide options to enable and disable `strip_tags`
and `strip_slashes` from the input text.
