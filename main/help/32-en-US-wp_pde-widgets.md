PDE is most useful for creating form based plugin elements like widgets.

For creating a widget, from the `Plugin Elements` box select Widget from the `Type`
dropdown and click on `Add to Plugin`. PDE creates a new widget with the given name
and the widget editor is shown in the form editor area.

In the form editor area, you can change the parameters or add new form items.

#### Parameters

* _Theme_

    Select a theme.

* _Wrapping_

    Select the `Do not wrap the widget with before_widget and after_widget markup`
    option to let PDE **not** generate the markup.

* _Description_

    Provide a description for this widget. This is shown in the Widgets screen of 
    wordpress.

* _Width and Height_

    If set, this values are passed to the widget through control operations.

When a new widget is created, PDE adds the title element to the widget. You can
add more form elements to a widget. See `Forms` help for more details.

Do not forget to click on the `Save` option to save your changes.
