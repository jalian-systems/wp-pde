You can use PDE to add actions and filters to the plugin.

For adding a action or a filter open the `Plugin Elements` meta box, if it is not already open,
using `Screen Options`. Select either `Action` or `Filter` from the `Type` dropdown.
Provide a name for the action/filter (like _wp\_head_, _wp\_excerpt_ etc.) in the `Action` or `Filter`
text field, give a name for the method and click on `Add to Plugin` option. PDE adds
the hook and opens the hook method in the editor.

PDE displays the actions and filters in the plugin in a list to the right of the editor area.
Click on the trash icon to delete an action or a filter from the plugin.
