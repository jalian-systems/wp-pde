#### Creating a plugin

If you are not in a new plugin screen, click on `+` in the top tab bar to open
a new tab. Enter a `Plugin Name` and `Version` number and click on the 
`Create Plugin` button. PDE creates a new plugin and generates the source for
it.

#### Duplicating a plugin

For **duplicating** a plugin, either change the `Plugin Name` or `Version` and
click on the `Save Plugin` option. PDE provides an option to either save the 
changes or create a new plugin with the changed data.

#### Testing a plugin

Click on the `Enable Plugin` option to make this plugin available for testing in
the current wordpress installation. All the displayed fields like widget name,
post type etc. will be suffixed with 'dev' to differentiate from the normal
plugins.

#### Exporting a plugin

You can use PDE to export the plugin in a ZIP format. Click on the `Export` option
to save the ZIP file.
